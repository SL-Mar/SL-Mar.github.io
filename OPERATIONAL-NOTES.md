### Website Restructuring and Navigation Simplification

**Objective:** Streamline website navigation and create dedicated showcase page for n8n workflow automation.

#### Changes Implemented

1. **Navigation Consolidation**
   - Moved Local AI content from standalone page to Publications page (first section, expanded by default)
   - Converted `chat-with-solas.html` to redirect to `development.html`
   - Converted `rnd-notes.html` to redirect to `publications.html`
   - Removed "R&D Notes" and "Local AI" from navigation menus
   - Final navigation structure:
     - Home
     - Publications
     - Development
     - n8n Automation
     - Contact

2. **n8n Automation Showcase Page**
   - Created `/n8n-automation.html` with simplified content
   - Single screenshot demonstration (n8n1.png - AI Market Intelligence Pipeline)
   - Focused content structure:
     - What is n8n? (purpose: task automation, prototyping, unit testing)
     - Example Workflow explanation
     - Links to official documentation and Publications section
   - Color scheme: Blue/green theme (#2196F3 for badges, #4CAF50 for headings)
   - Removed verbose sections: Capabilities cards, Featured Workflows, Technology Stack badges, Use Cases, Deployment Architecture, Example Workflow details, Advanced Features, Benefits of Self-Hosting

3. **Development Page Updates**
   - Updated subtitle: "Full-Stack development for quantitative finance and marine applications"
   - Removed n8n Workflow Automation project card (separate dedicated page now)
   - Removed "Project Overview" button from Chat with SOLAS section
   - Kept only QuantCoderFS and Chat with SOLAS projects

4. **Contact Page**
   - Added line break in paragraph: "Specializing in local AI solutions..." (split into two lines)

5. **Assets Management**
   - Copied n8n workflow screenshots from `/home/slmar/Pictures/` to `Assets/`:
     - `n8n1.png` - AI Market Intelligence Pipeline (used on page)
     - `n8n2.png` - RAG Question-Answering System
     - `n8n3.png` - Automated Document Processing

#### Technical Details

- All redirect pages use meta refresh + JavaScript fallback
- Navigation order carefully considered: n8n Automation placed before Contact (Contact is last)
- Color scheme consistency: Blue (#2196F3) for links and tech badges, Green (#4CAF50) for headings
- Responsive design maintained with existing CSS grid system

#### Files Modified

- `index.html` - Navigation updates, n8n project card added
- `publications.html` - Local AI section added, navigation updated
- `development.html` - Subtitle changed, n8n section removed, navigation updated
- `contact.html` - Line break added, navigation updated
- `n8n-automation.html` - Created new page, simplified content, navigation updated
- `chat-with-solas.html` - Converted to redirect
- `rnd-notes.html` - Converted to redirect

#### Git Commits

1. Initial n8n page creation with comprehensive content
2. Color scheme update to blue/green theme
3. Content condensation - removed verbose sections
4. Removed n8n from development page
5. Simplified n8n page to single screenshot with explanation
6. Added spacing and navigation order adjustment

#### Lessons Learned

- Browser caching can show old versions - users should hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- GitHub Pages may take 1-2 minutes to deploy changes
- Simplified content is more effective than comprehensive feature lists
- Navigation order matters for user experience (Contact should be last)

#### Future Considerations

- Monitor user engagement with simplified n8n page
- Consider adding more workflow examples if user feedback requests it
- May need to update screenshots if workflows change significantly
- Keep Publications page as central hub for all written content

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Projects

1. Add to `development.html` as new `<article>` section
2. Add project card to `index.html` in Projects section
3. Create documentation page in subdirectory (e.g., `project-name/docs.html`)
4. Update navigation if dedicated showcase page is needed

### Navigation Updates

When changing navigation structure:
- Update all 5 main pages: `index.html`, `publications.html`, `development.html`, `contact.html`, `n8n-automation.html`
- Update any subdirectory documentation pages (e.g., `quantcoderfs/docs.html`)
- Maintain consistent order across all pages
- Keep "Contact" as last navigation item

### Color Scheme Reference

- **Primary green:** #4CAF50 (headings, borders, highlights)
- **Primary blue:** #2196F3 (links, tech badges)
- **Background overlays:** rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05) for cards
- **Text secondary:** #ccc for body text
- **Border subtle:** rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)

### Redirect Pages

Format for deprecated pages:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=target-page.html">
    <title>Redirecting...</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        window.location.href = "target-page.html";
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Redirecting to <a href="target-page.html">Target Page</a>...</p>
</body>
</html>
```
